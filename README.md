1) For the traits to be detected, a folder directory named `traits` should be created with every traits properly categorized in their own sub-folder directory. 
2) A folder directory named `output` should also be created where all the generated images will go to.
3) `resizer.py` can be used to generate all the traits in similar dimensions that can be specified in the file itself, otherwise the script would not work. 
Make sure all the appropriate traits are already created and categorized.
4) You can then generate the metadata after your images are generated through `generate_metadata.py`

Most of the variables that can be edited especially regarding traits are quite self-explanatory in the code and are commented appropriately.

NOTE: You can always rename the variables in `generate_nft.py` as well to change the name for the instructions above.
